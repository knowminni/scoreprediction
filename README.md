# Score Prediction using Linear Regression

This machine learning model has been made in accordance to the instructions by The Sparks Foundation's Data Science and Analytics Internship.
Task 1:
To create a simple Linear Regression Model that can predict the possible percentage that can be scored by a student if they study for a given number of hours in a day.

The sample data source was in a raw format, which was converted into CSV format for perusal.

The repository contains the IPYNB, source data file and the linear regression model.

HyperParamater Tuning of the model was done using GridSearchCV.
